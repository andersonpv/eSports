            <h1>Tournaments</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience. The
                tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety
                of the event, like the World Cyber Games. Competitions take several formats, but the most common are
                single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage. Competitions usually have referees
                or officials to monitor for cheating.[116]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant
                transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments
                became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in person
                and online brought esports to a wider audience.[2][117] Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games,
                the North American Major League Gaming league, the France-based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the
                World e-Sports Games held in Hangzhou, China.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year.[118][119]
                As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632
                registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. League of Legends awarded approximately
                $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides
                salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series.[120] Nonetheless, there has
                been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a
                few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player.[121] In
                August 2018, The International 2018, Valve's annual premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke the
                record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament, amounting to over US$25
                million.[122]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Often, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly,[118] but sponsorship may
                also come from third parties, typically companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer
                software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand-alone venture.[123] For
                example, Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship Series is "a significant
                investment that we're not making money from".[124]</p>
            <br>
            <p>There is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and
                tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea
                largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to
                authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II.[125] In the short term, this led to a deadlock with
                the Korean e-Sports Association.[126] An agreement was reached in 2012.[127] Blizzard requires
                authorization for tournaments with more than $10,000 USD in prizes.[128] Riot Games offers in-game
                rewards to authorized tournaments.[129]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Esport competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre conventions.</p>
