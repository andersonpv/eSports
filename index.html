                <h1>eSports</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of competition using video
                    games. Most commonly, esports takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions,
                    particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized online and
                    offline
                    competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the
                    late
                    2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live
                    streaming
                    saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game
                    industry, with many game developers actively designing toward a professional esports subculture.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA),
                    first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, digital collectible card games, battle royale games and real-time
                    strategy (RTS). Popular esports titles include MOBA games such as, League of Legends, Dota 2 and Smite,
                    FPS
                    titles such as Counter-Strike and Call of Duty, CrossFire and Rainbow Six Siege which are in the FPS
                    sub-genre of tactical shooters , Overwatch which is in the FPS sub-genre of hero shooter , fighting
                    games
                    such as Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros., Mortal Kombat and Soulcalibur, Beat 'em up such as Dungeon
                    Fighter Online, digital collectible card games such as Hearthstone, Battle royale games such as
                    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale, and RTS titles StarCraft. Tournaments such as
                    the
                    League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's The International, the fighting games-specific Evolution
                    Championship Series (EVO), and the Intel Extreme Masters provide live broadcasts of the competition and
                    prize money to competitors. Many competitions use a series of promotion and relegation play with
                    sponsored
                    teams, such as the League of Legends World Championship, but more recently, competitions structured
                    similar
                    to American professional sports, with salaried players and regular season and play-off series, have
                    emerged,
                    such as the Overwatch League. The legitimacy of esports as a sports competition remains in question;
                    however, esports has been featured alongside traditional sports in multinational events, and the
                    International Olympic Committee has explored incorporating them into future Olympic events.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By 2019, it is estimated that 427 million people worldwide will be watching some form of esports. The
                    increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly Panda.tv, YouTube, and Twitch
                    have
                    become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions. Demographically, Major League Gaming
                    has reported viewership that is approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers
                    between
                    the ages of 18 and 34.[5] Despite this, several female personalities within esports are hopeful about
                    the
                    increasing presence of female gamers. South Korea has several established esports organizations, which
                    have licensed pro gamers since the year 2000. Recognition of esports competitions outside of South Korea
                    has
                    come somewhat slower. Along with South Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and
                    China. Despite its large video game market, esports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, and this has
                    been
                    attributed largely to its broad anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming
                    tournaments.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The global esports market generated US$325 million of revenue in 2015 and was expected to make $493
                    million
                    in 2016. The global esports audience in 2015 was 226 million people. According to a Newzoo report in
                    April 2017, 42% of the gaming market belongs to the mobile industry, and mobile is projected to claim
                    more
                    than 50% the market by 2020. The esports industry is expanding beyond PC and console, as developer
                    Super Evil Megacorp created Vainglory, the first mobile multiplayer online battle arena game, and
                    companies like Skillz bring esports tournaments to mobile games.</p>
