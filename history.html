            <h1>History</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Early history (1972–1989)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the
                game Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an "Intergalactic spacewar olympics" whose grand
                prize was a year's subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all
                tournament and Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the Team Competition. The Space Invaders
                Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more
                than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream
                hobby.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the summer of 1980, Walter Day founded a high score record keeping organization called Twin
                Galaxies. The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through
                publications such as the Guinness Book of World Records, and in 1983 it created the U.S. National Video
                Game Team. The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for
                Guinness World Records and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, video game players and tournaments began being featured in well-circulated
                newspapers and popular magazines including Life and Time. One of the most well known classic arcade
                game players is Billy Mitchell, who was credited with the records for high scores in six games including
                Pac-Man and Donkey Kong in the 1985 issue of the Guinness Book of World Records. Some of those
                records would be removed in 2018 amid allegations of fraud.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Televised esports events aired during this period included the American show Starcade which ran between
                1982 and 1984 airing a total of 133 episodes, on which contestants would attempt to beat each other's
                high scores on an arcade game. A video game tournament was included as part of TV show That's
                Incredible!, and tournaments were also featured as part of the plot of various films, including
                1982's Tron. In the UK, the BBC game show First Class included competitive video game rounds
                featuring the contemporary arcade games Hyper Sports, 720° and Paperboy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The 1988 game Netrek was an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in
                cross-platform open source software. Netrek was the third Internet game, the first Internet game to use
                metaservers to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent user information. In 1993 it
                was credited by Wired Magazine as "the first online sports game".</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Growth and online video games (1990–1999)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level
                competition between two players.[31] Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to
                determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead
                challenge each other directly, "face-to-face," to determine the best player,[31] paving the way for the
                competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games.[32] The popularity of
                fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the
                international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured
                across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo
                held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo
                PowerFest '94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi
                took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s,
                co-hosted by GamePro magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
                and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included NBA Jam and Virtua
                Racing.[33]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Television shows featuring esports during this period included the British shows GamesMaster and Bad
                Influence! the Australian game show A*mazing, where in one round contestants competed in a video game
                face off, and the Canadian game show Video & Arcade Top 10.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing internet connectivity, especially PC games.
                Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), QuakeCon,
                and the Professional Gamers League. PC games played at the CPL included the Counter-Strike series, Quake
                series, and Warcraft. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Professional leagues</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In most esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored
                teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this
                follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. However, with rising interest
                in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the approach used in
                North American professional sports, in which all teams participate in a regular season of matches to vie
                for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger
                investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport's premiere league
                and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing.[61]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Blizzard Entertainment announced the Overwatch League, based on its Overwatch game, in 2016, with its
                inaugural regular season featuring twelve teams starting in January 2018. Players that get contracts to
                play on teams are guaranteed an annual salary and benefits, as well as sharing of the team's revenue and
                prize winnings; the first season had a total prize pool of US$3.5 million available, with US$1 million
                to the team winning in post-season.[62]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Take-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K
                League, using the NBA 2K game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional
                sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30
                professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season is set to start May 2018 with 17 teams.[63] Similarly, EA
                Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS, a league using EA's FIFA 18; in its inaugural
                season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams will manage teams for the eMLS.[</p>
