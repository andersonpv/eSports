            <h1>Ethics</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Pro gamers are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by
                tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good sportsmanship.
                For
                example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to chat "gg" (for "good game") when
                defeated.[142] Many games rely on the fact competitors have limited information about the game state. In
                a
                prominent example of good conduct, during a 2012 IEM StarCraft II game, the players Feast and DeMusliM
                both
                voluntarily offered information about their strategies to negate the influence of outside information
                inadvertently leaked to "Feast" during the game.[143] Players in some leagues have been reprimanded for
                failure to comply with expectations of good behavior. In 2012 professional League of Legends player
                Christian "IWillDominate" Riviera was banned from competing for a period of one year following a history
                of
                verbal abuse.[144] In 2013 StarCraft II progamer Greg "Idra" Fields was fired from Evil Geniuses for
                insulting his fans on the Team Liquid internet forums.[145] League of Legends players Mithy and Nukeduck
                received similar penalties in 2014 after behaving in a "toxic" manner during matches.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Team Siren, an all-female League of Legends team, was formed in June 2013. The announcement of the team
                was
                met with controversy, being dismissed as a "gimmick" to attract the attention of men.[147][148] The team
                disbanded within a month, due to the negative publicity of their promotional video, as well as the poor
                attitude of the team captain towards her teammates.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There have been serious violations of the rules. In 2010, eleven StarCraft: Brood War players were found
                guilty of fixing matches for profit, and were fined and banned from future competition. Team Curse and
                Team
                Dignitas were denied prize money for collusion during the 2012 MLG Summer Championship.[151] In 2012,
                League
                of Legends team Azubu Frost was fined US$30,000 for cheating during a semifinal match of the world
                playoffs.[152] Dota 2 player Aleksey "Solo" Berezin was suspended from a number of tournaments for
                intentionally throwing a game in order to collect $322 from online gambling.[153] In 2014, four
                high-profile
                North American Counter-Strike players from iBuyPower, namely Sam "DaZeD" Marine, Braxton "swag" Pierce,
                Joshua "steel" Nissan and Keven "AZK" Lariviere were suspended from official tournaments after they had
                been
                found guilty of match-fixing. The four players had allegedly profited over US$10,000 through betting on
                their fixed matches.[154] Gambling on esports using Counter-Strike: Global Offense "skins", worth an
                estimated US$2.3 billion in 2015, had come under criticism in June and July 2016 after several
                questionable
                legal and ethical aspects of the practice were discovered.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Performance-enhancing drugs</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Reports of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players
                discussing their own, their teammates' and their competitors' use and officials acknowledging the
                prevalence
                of the issue.[156][157][158] Players often turn to stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall and Vyvanse,
                drugs
                which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time and prevent fatigue.[156] Selegiline,
                a
                drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reportedly popular because, like stimulants, it enhances mood
                and
                motivation. Conversely, drugs with calming effects are also sought after. Some players take propanolol,
                which blocks the effects of adrenaline, or Valium, which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorder, in
                order
                to remain calm under pressure.[157] According to Bjoern Franzen, a former SK Gaming executive, it is
                second
                nature for some League of Legends players to take as many as three different drugs before
                competition.[159]
                In July 2015 Kory "Semphis" Friesen, an ex-Cloud9 player, admitted that he and his teammates were all
                using
                Adderall during a match against Virtus.pro in the ESL One Katowice 2015 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
                tournament, and went on to claim that "everyone" at ESEA League tournaments uses Adderall.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors' health, including addiction,
                overdose,
                serotonin syndrome and, in the case of stimulants, weight loss.[156][157] Even over-the-counter energy
                drinks which are marketed specifically toward gamers have faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to
                deaths
                and hospitalizations.[160] Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use
                penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the
                National
                Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World
                Anti-Doping
                Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions.[156] Action has
                been
                taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports
                League,
                has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition.[161] Although not all
                players use drugs, it is common to see gamers use energy boosters or drinks. They commonly drink
                caffeinated
                drinks or use energy pills.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Player exploitation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by
                organizations,
                especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive
                salaries,
                leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, League of Legends player
                Bae
                "Dade" Eo-jin said that "Korean players wake up at 1pm and play until 5am", and suggested that the 16
                hour
                play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout.[162] Concerns over the mental health of
                players
                intensified in 2014 when League of Legends player Cheon "Promise" Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after
                admitting to match fixing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To combat the negative environment, Korean League of Legends teams were given new rules for the upcoming
                2015 season by Riot Games, including the adoption of minimum salaries for professional players,
                requiring
                contracts and allowing players to stream individually for additional player revenue.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Players must handle their own treatments and carry their own medical insurance, which is opposite of the
                norm with professional sports teams. Since most esports play requires many actions per minute, some
                players
                may get repetitive strain injuries, causing hand or wrist pain.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Economics</h2>
            <br>
            <p>League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for
                players.[166] Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as it is in some cases more
                profitable than competing with a team and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule.
                The
                International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same
                amount
                of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research that the global esports industry generated revenue of
                around
                US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading esports market with over $321 million in revenue, North
                America is around $224 million, and Europe has $172 million and the rest of the world for about $29
                million.[168] Global esports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The number of female viewers has been growing in esports, with an estimated 30% of esports viewers being
                female in 2013, an increase from 15% from the previous year.[citation needed] However, despite the
                increase
                in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive esports.[citation
                needed] The top female players that are involved in esports mainly get exposure in female-only
                tournaments,
                most notably Counter-Strike, Dead or Alive 4, and StarCraft II. All-female esports teams include Frag
                Dolls
                and PMS Clan.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Gambling</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Gambling and betting on esport matches have generally been illegal in major markets. The illegality of
                esport gambling has created a black market related to esports and virtual currency, as these go
                unregulated,
                may encourage match-fixing by players themselves, and lead to concerns about underage gambling due to
                the
                draw of video games. One such example of this is skin gambling, where virtual items earned in games were
                used as a currency for users to bet on the outcome of matches.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Esports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports
                Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) until May 2018. The Act prevented all but five states from allowing
                gambling
                on sporting events.[169] However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some
                betting
                houses in Nevada, where sports betting is already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as
                non-competitive
                "other events" similar to the selection of the Heisman Trophy winner or NFL Draft to be legal.[169]
                Other
                companies established in the United States allow for legal esports betting for international users but
                are
                restricted from Americans. Nevada legalized esports gambling in June 2017, classifying esports alongside
                competitive sports and dog racing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic
                Association
                in May 2018, PASPA was found unconstitutional, as the Court ruled that the federal government cannot
                limit
                states from regulating sports betting. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in
                the
                United States.[171] However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its
                bill
                to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where
                most
                players are over 18 years of age.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the Federal Wire Act,
                preventing
                users from betting on national esports events outside of the state.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Data analytics and machine learning</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With the growing popularity of machine learning in data analytics,[citation needed] esports has been the
                focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge
                number of matches played on a daily basis globally (League of Legends alone had a reported 100 million
                active monthly players worldwide in 2016[173] and an average of 27 million League of Legends games
                played
                per day reported in 2014[174]), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning
                platforms.
                Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to-visualize
                graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win
                probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition.[175] In 2018, the DotA team
                Team
                Liquid partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team's success rate
                in
                each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Game cancellations</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As more esport competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or
                developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game's esport activities is tied to that company.
                In
                December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of Heroes of
                the
                Storm and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional Heroes players
                and
                coaches recognizing their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at
                Blizzard's decision.</p>
