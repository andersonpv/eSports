            <h1>Media</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>News reporting</h2>
            <br>
            <p>main medium for esports coverage is the Internet. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news
                reporting websites, such as ESPN, Yahoo!, Sport1, Kicker, and Aftonbladet started dedicated esports
                coverage.[179][180] esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary
                of games in progress, similar to a traditional sports commentator. For popular casters, providing
                commentary for esports can be a full-time position by itself.[181] Prominent casters for StarCraft II
                include Dan "Artosis" Stemkoski and Nick "Tasteless" Plott.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2018, the Associated Press' AP Stylebook officially began spelling the word as "esports", dropping
                support for both the capital "S" and the dash between "e" and "sports" styles, similar to how "e-mail"
                transformed with common usage to "email".[182][183] Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as "Ninja",
                became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he
                appeared in the September 2018 issue of ESPN The Magazine.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Internet live streaming</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Many esports events are streamed online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d
                streaming service in 2013, Twitch is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing
                against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and YouTube Gaming.[185][186] Dreamhack Winter 2011
                reached 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch.[187] While coverage of live events usually brings in the
                largest viewership counts, the recent popularization of streaming services has allowed individuals to
                broadcast their own gameplay independent of such events as well. Individual broadcasters can enter an
                agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from
                commercials which run on the stream they create.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another major streaming platform was Major League Gaming's MLG.tv.[189] The network, which specializes
                in Call of Duty content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376%
                growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014.[190] The 2014 Call of Duty: Ghosts broadcast at MLG's X Games
                event drew over 160,000 unique viewers.[191] The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast
                themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv
                was the primary streaming platform for the Call of Duty professional scene; famous players such as
                NaDeSHoT and Scump have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively.[192]
                In January 2016, MLG was acquired by Activision Blizzard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>YouTube also relaunched its livestreaming platform with a renewed focus on live gaming and esports
                specifically.[194] For The International 2014, coverage was also simulcast on ESPN's streaming service
                ESPN3.[195] In December 2016, Riot Games announced a deal with MLB Advanced Media's technology division
                BAM Tech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of League of Legends events through 2023.
                BAM Tech will pay Riot at least $300 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.</p>
